hiearchical_configparser.py:

Like a regular configparser, but supports the INCLUDE= statement.
If INCLUDE=filename.ini is present in any section, the contents of that section are
read from filename.ini. If filename.ini includes its own INCLUDE=, that is included as well.

Name/value pairs in the included file are read FIRST, so that they can be shadowed by name/value
pairs in the including file. 

If the INCLUDE= is when the [DEFAULT] section, then the values of *every* section are incluced.
